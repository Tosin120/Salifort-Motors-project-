# Salifort-Motors-project-
There is a lot of personnel turnover at Salifort Motors. The goal of leadership is to foresee and handle it. HR asks workers questions to find out why. They want a specialist in data analysis to examine the information and create a departure prediction model, maybe with the help of machine learning or statistics.

In order to develop predictive models that might offer the Human Resources (HR) department insights, this capstone project analyzes the dataset.
